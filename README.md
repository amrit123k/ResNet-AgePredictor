ResNet-AgePredictor is a deep learning project that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks to estimate the age of individuals from facial images. Built on top of the ResNet architecture, this model is trained on a dataset of labeled face images and uses transfer learning techniques to achieve accurate age regression.

The project includes:
- Preprocessing pipelines for dataset, images
- Data analysis before model training
- A ResNet-based architecture fine-tuned for age prediction
- Training, validation, and testing scripts
- Model evaluation metrics and conclusion

This project is intended for educational, research, and demo purposes, and can serve as a starting point for further experimentation in computer vision, biometrics, or age-related demographic analysis.
